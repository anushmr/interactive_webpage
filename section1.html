            <h2>Let's see how people prefer their coffee in different countries.</h2>
        </p>
        <p><i>Italy: Espresso</i><br>
            <p>Espresso is basically a way of life for Italians. Made quick to order and topped with a thin layer of
                cream,
                espressos are most commonly consumed standing at the bar in a cafe.
                Espressos are a great start to an Italian day, not to mention they make for a perfect Instagram.

                <p><i>Cuba: Cafè Cubana</i><br>
                    <p>Café Cubano is Cuba’s version of an espresso, adding some demerara sugar to sweeten up the brew.
                        While this is most popular in Cuba, it’s also a favorite in some regions of Florida, especially
                        Miami.
                        So if you aren’t up for the trip to Cuba, make a short stop in Miami and find this coffee at
                        almost any cafe.
                    </p>

                    <p><i>Saudi Arabia: Al-Qahwa</i><br>
                        <p>This coffee is not only seen in Saudi Arabia, but in other Arabic countries as well.
                            It is typically made with Cardamom, an expensive spice found in South Asia.
                            Al-Quhwa is commonly served with dates, dried fruits or nuts.
                            It’s time to spicen up your boring black coffee by trying this traditional Arabic beverage.
                        </p>


                        <p><i>Ireland: Irish Coffee</i><br>
                            <p>Chances are you’ve probably had an Irish coffee at least once in your life,
                                even if it wasn’t in a cute Dublin pub. This hot coffee is prepared with Irish whiskey,
                                sugar and a layer of whipped cream.
                                More like a dessert rather than a quick breakfast, Irish coffee embraces Ireland’s pub
                                culture to its fullest.
                            </p>

                            <p><i>Mexico: Café de Olla</i><br>
                                <p>Café de Olla has a very distinct taste. Made with cinnamon and piloncillo,
                                    a native Mexican sugar, this coffee is popular all over Latin America.
                                    Part of what gives this coffee its distinct taste is its preparation in earthen clay
                                    pots.
                                    Next time you travel to Mexico, order this drink instead of your usual margarita.
                                </p>

                                <p><i>Spain: Café Bombón</i><br>
                                    <p> Originating in Valencia, Spain, this coffee is prepared as half espresso and
                                        half sweetened condensed milk.
                                        To make this espresso alternative more aesthetically pleasing, it is typically
                                        served in a clear glass.
                                        Next time you happen to be in Spain, order this classic to impress the locals.
                                    </p>
